Start the Engine (Windows)
--------------------------

Navigate to folder :file:`bin` and double click on :file:`ControlCenter.exe` to
start the Control Center. You can use this tool to start and stop the Axon Ivy
Engine in different ways (as a Windows Service, as a normal user process, or with a
console window). Select the Axon Ivy Engine and press the green play button to
start the Axon Ivy Engine as a normal user process:

.. Hint::
  You can use the Control Center also to register Axon Ivy Engine as Windows
  Service. Moreover, you can add other existing Windows Services to the list of
  Engines to start and stop them with the Control Center. For example, if you
  have installed your database server on the same machine, you can add the
  Windows Service of the database server. To register Axon Ivy Engine as
  Windows Service, you need to **run the Control Center as Administrator**.

After the Axon Ivy Engine has been started it opens a web browser displaying the
main page of the |ivy-engine|.
