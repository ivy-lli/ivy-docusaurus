Prepare your Server (Linux)
---------------------------

Add the software and tools needed for the installation and operation of the Axon
Ivy Engine (sudo, wget, unzip, Java 17 runtime). Most distributions have these
tools pre-installed, but some Docker images may not.

Make sure that your server fulfills the hardware and software requirements of the |ivy-engine|.
