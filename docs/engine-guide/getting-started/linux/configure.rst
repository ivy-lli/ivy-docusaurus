Configure the Engine (Linux)

Manual Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shutdown the Axon Ivy Engine first by typing **shutdown** and **Y**::

    ...
    Go to http://ivy1:8080/ to see the info page of Axon Ivy Engine.
    Axon Ivy Engine is running and ready to serve. [11596ms]
    Type 'shutdown' and confirm with ENTER to stop the running engine instance
    ...
    
    shutdown
    
    ...
    Should 'Axon Ivy Engine' be stopped? ([Y]es / [N]o): Y
    Stopping Axon Ivy Engine ...
    [  0%] Stopping Server
    ...

Let's install the license. Copy the license file :file:`*.lic` into folder
:file:`configuration`.

.. code:: bash

    cp ~/licence.lic /opt/ivy/engine/latest/configuration

To configure the system database, use the :code:`config-db` command of the
**EngineConfigCli** tool. Replace **yourdatabaseserver** with the hostname of
the server running your DBMS system. Replace **dbuser** and **password** with
the credentials of a database user with the permissions to create a new
database and its structures (i.e. DDL permissions) on the database server.

.. code:: bash

    ./EngineConfigCli config-db org.postgresql.Driver \
    jdbc:postgresql://yourdatabaseserver:5432/AxonIvySystemDatabase \
    dbuser password

Now, let's create the system database with the :code:`create-db` command.

.. code:: bash

    ./EngineConfigCli create-db

.. Note::
  The Axon Ivy Engine uses the system database to store **master data** like
  users, user attributes, roles, etc. as well as **runtime data** like
  applications, process models, process model versions, cases, tasks, and
  **process data**.

Next, define an Axon Ivy Engine administrator by modifying :ref:`ivy-yaml` 
in directory :file:`/etc/axonivy-engine-|major-version|` as detailed below:

.. literalinclude:: sample-ivy.yaml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:

.. Note::  
  Administrators manage the Axon Ivy Engine. For example, they add or remove
  users, assign users to roles, enable, disable and deploy applications, etc. You need at
  least one administrator to manage the Axon Ivy Engine. In case of license
  problems, the Axon Ivy Engine sends mail notifications to the administrators.

.. include:: ../_webserver.rst

Now, start the Axon Ivy Engine again as a background process.

.. code:: bash

    nohup ./AxonIvyEngine &

.. Note:: 
  If you have changed the HTTP Settings, the HTTP port of the Axon Ivy Engine may have changed! 

Open a web browser and navigate to http://yourservername:yourportnumber/. As you
see, the header with the demo mode message is gone. You now have a
production-ready Axon Ivy Engine.
