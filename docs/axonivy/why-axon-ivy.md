  make new business opportunities possible. You are still the captain of your
  ship, start with simple automations and transform essential parts of your
  business when you gain trust and confidence.

  It has never been easier to document processes fast and intuitive. The process
  simulation allows you to verify that you have a shared view how processes
  should be executed. Setup a simple structure for the data of a processes and
  you even get a simple executable application with generated front ends that
  are meaningful. No software engineer is required to create an already powerful
  application from scratch.

  test of time. We minimize your technology evaluation effort by giving you a
  set of libraries and an IDE that match perfectly together. This allows you to
  quickly jump into projects and deliver value. While you always have the
  ability to break out of our predefined tooling and use advanced features of
  Tomcat, JPA, JSF, JAX-RS or whatever you require.

  orchestrate your existing systems. We support many DB vendors (Oracle,
  Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) Effective monitoring and logging
  interfaces are provided to give you a safety that the application is healthy
  and accessible.
