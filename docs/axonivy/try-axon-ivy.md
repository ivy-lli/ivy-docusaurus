# Try Axon Ivy

The |ivy-designer| is free of charge. You can start developing your projects
right away.

We offer you two ways to try the |ivy-engine|:

## Demo Mode

The Axon Ivy Engine runs out-of-the-box with a demo licence and an in-memory
database. As long as you don't restart the engine, you can do everything you can
do with a licensed, production-ready engine.

To try the |ivy-engine| this way, follow the Engine Guide Chapter :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started>` but skip the license
installation.

## Cloud Trial

If you want to try an Axon Ivy Engine with a persisting database, you can get a
trial engine in the cloud via [Try it now](https://www.axonivy.com/try-it-now). It comes
complete with a two-week trial license and full web access to the engine.

With this option, you don't need to install an engine - use a local Axon Ivy
Designer to develop your trial project and deploy it to the engine in the cloud.
