# What is Axon Ivy?

Axon Ivy is a Process Automation Platform that simplifies and automates the
interaction of humans with their digital systems. The platform is typically in
charge of the most precious business cases where companies produce value. Here
is how we do it:

**Visualize**
    Our platform allows you to **document business processes fast and
    intuitive**. A shared view on users, roles, departments and technical
    systems that are involved in a business process improves your work. HR
    recruitment profiles become clearer, bottle necks become obvious, ideas for
    effective improvements arise by anyone who is involved in the process.

**Automate**
    Documented processes are good. But what you really want is to **drive your
    highly valuable processes automatically**. Often the daily work of employees
    is interrupted by searching and filtering data from various tools and by
    feeding this data into other technical systems. Even tough value is produced
    in a well-known business case, there is a lack of a clear interface which
    guides the involved users through the process. Highly valuable data is often
    divided and stored in various dedicated technical systems. With Axon Ivy
    you can drive your process automatically. People, data and technical systems
    can easily be orchestrated by our platform. An initial application that
    leads users through the process can be generated without the need to hire a
    software engineer. People can contribute to the process by using their
    favorite device such as a smartphone or workstation.

**Improve**
    The digitalization of your company can **evolve over time**, we favor small
    predictable improvements over big bang solutions. The Axon Ivy Platform allows
    you to start simple and fast with your existing environment. You may start
    with just task notifications that are sent to users that should contribute
    to a running process. And eventually the platform becomes your single
    interface for all your business interactions. You will be able to measure
    KPIs based on the highly valuable data that is produced during the execution
    of your business processes. Based on these insights, you can advance your
    business constantly and effectively. The cost of business transformations
    become reasonable and predictable.

The Axon Ivy Platform consists on the one hand of the
:ref:`Axon Ivy Designer <designer-guide>` which
enables the drawing, simulation and implementation of automated business
processes. The other part is the application server
:ref:`Axon Ivy Engine <engine-guide>` that
executes your business cases and provides a shared interface for process users.
